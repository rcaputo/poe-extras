Things We Support That Others Dont
===================================
      *  <!-- --> comments
      *  *BOLD*, _underline_, <u>underline</u>
      *  $WantSearch turns off/on the search box
      *  $WantTopLinkBar turns off/on the top link bar
      *  mailto:foo@bar support improved
      *  link to login form
      *  indication of who you're logged in as
      *  config.custom overrides defaults from config
         (also keeps new config files from clobbering them)
      *  dynamic $DataDir based on DOCUMENT_ROOT
      *  hardcoded link, visited, active, and text colors to go along
         with the white background
      *  Improved ISBN support via ISBN.nu and an option to disable extras.
      *  WORKS WITH MODPERL
           <Files "index.cgi">
              Options ExecCGI
              SetHandler perl-script
              PerlHandler Apache::PerlRun
              PerlSendHeader Off
           </Files>
         and working to support Apache::Registry.
      * <components></components>
      * <boxes></boxes> to describe test machines
      * <tests></tests> (or something) to describe tests
      * <components></components> to describe POE components
      * <projects></projects> to describe POE projects
1.32  * $ReverseTitle supports reversing title elements order
      * Unduplicates titles - "LP: LP" becomes "LP".
1.33  * $EnableSelfLinks option to handle the top-of-page search links
1.34  * $Footer allows you to add a custom footer to every document.
        It turns out 0.94 usemod does this differently.
1.37  * http:/{0,2}? links translate properly to ?something now.
1.39  * $DataDir is detected properly and can be overridden later.
       and working to support Apache::Registry.
1.41  * $ForceLcaseFiles will make link/file matching case insensitive
        by forcing filenames to lowercase.  It tries to find files by
        their case-significant names first so existing pages aren't
        orphaned.
      * Added ./utils/lcase-data.perl to rename data files to lowercase
        so ForceLcaseFiles works better.
1.45  * Requires Text::Template now
      * The html which wraps around the wiki nodes is now in templates.
        in data/templates , header.html and footer.html comprise this
        html. happy customizing.

Things Needing Fixes
====================

      * @HtmlPairs doesn't support nested things.
        Can't mix <font><b></b></font>, for example.

      * The <boxes></boxes>, etc. "semantic markup" tags should probably
	be done as a generic facility.  Define the general <foo></foo>
	syntax, and write a parser for it.  Load a template associated
	with "foo", and stuff the parsed fields into that.  Return the
	generated HTML, and never have to code another StoreFoo sub again.

      * It would be sweet once the <foo></foo> semantic template thing is
        done if the templates could be editable via wiki.  Then there's
	hardly any call for uploading updates to the site again.

      * It may also be useful to associate a style sheet with each template.
