=head1 NAME

POE::Kernel - an event driven threaded application kernel in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

POE comes with its own event loop, which is based on select() and
written entirely in Perl.  To use it, simply:

  use POE;

POE can adapt itself to work with other event loops and I/O multiplex
systems.  Currently it adapts to Gtk, Tk, Event.pm, or IO::Poll when
one of those modules is used before POE::Kernel.

  use Gtk;  # Or Tk, Event, or IO::Poll;
  use POE;

  or

  use POE qw(Loop::Gtk);

  or

  use POE::Kernel { loop => "Gtk" };
  use POE::Session;

Methods to manage the process' global Kernel instance:

  # Retrieve the kernel's unique identifier.
  $kernel_id = $kernel->ID;

  # Run the event loop, only returning when it has no more sessions to
  # dispatch events to.  Supports two forms.
  $poe_kernel->run();
  POE::Kernel->run();

FIFO event methods:

  # Post an event to an arbitrary session.
  $kernel->post( $session, $event, @event_args );

  # Post an event back to the current session.
  $kernel->yield( $event, @event_args );

  # Call an event handler synchronously.  Bypasses POE's event queue
  # and returns the handler's return value.
  $handler_result = $kernel->call( $session, $event, @event_args );

Original alarm and delay methods:

  # Post an event which will be delivered at a given Unix epoch time.
  # This clears previous timed events with the same state name.
  $kernel->alarm( $event, $epoch_time, @event_args );

  # Post an additional alarm, leaving existing ones in the queue.
  $kernel->alarm_add( $event, $epoch_time, @event_args );

  # Post an event which will be delivered after a delay, specified in
  # seconds hence. This clears previous timed events with the same
  # name.
  $kernel->delay( $event, $seconds, @event_args );

  # Post an additional delay, leaving existing ones in the queue.
  $kernel->delay_add( $event, $seconds, @event_args );

June 2001 alarm and delay methods:

  # Post an event which will be delivered at a given Unix epoch
  # time. This does not clear previous events with the same name.
  $alarm_id = $kernel->alarm_set( $event, $epoch_time, @etc );

  # Post an event which will be delivered a number of seconds hence.
  # This does not clear previous events with the same name.
  $alarm_id = $kernel->delay_set( $event, $seconds_hence, @etc );

  # Adjust an existing alarm by a number of seconds.
  $kernel->alarm_adjust( $alarm_id, $number_of_seconds );

  # Refresh an existing delay to a number of seconds in the future.
  $kernel->delay_adjust( $delay_id, $number_of_seconds_hence );

  # Remove a specific alarm, regardless whether it shares a name with
  # others.
  $kernel->alarm_remove( $alarm_id );

  # Remove all alarms for the current session.
  $kernel->alarm_remove_all( );

Symbolic name, or session alias methods:

  # Set an alias for the current session.
  $status = $kernel->alias_set( $alias );

  # Clear an alias for the current session:
  $status = $kernel->alias_remove( $alias );

  # Resolve an alias into a session reference.  Most POE::Kernel
  # methods do this for you.
  $session_reference = $kernel->alias_resolve( $alias );

  # Resolve a session ID to a session reference.  The alias_resolve
  # method does this as well, but this is faster.
  $session_reference = $kernel->ID_id_to_session( $session_id );

  # Return a session ID for a session reference.  It is functionally
  # equivalent to $session->ID.
  $session_id = $kernel->ID_session_to_id( $session_reference );

  # Return a list of aliases for a session (or the current one, by
  # default).
  @aliases = $kernel->alias_list( $session );

Filehandle watcher methods:

  # Watch for read readiness on a filehandle.
  $kernel->select_read( $file_handle, $event, @optional_args );

  # Stop watching a filehandle for read-readiness.
  $kernel->select_read( $file_handle );

  # Watch for write readiness on a filehandle.
  $kernel->select_write( $file_handle, $event, @optional_args );

  # Stop watching a filehandle for write-readiness.
  $kernel->select_write( $file_handle );

  # Watch for out-of-bound (expedited) read readiness on a filehandle.
  $kernel->select_expedite( $file_handle, $event, @optional_args );

  # Stop watching a filehandle for out-of-bound data.
  $kernel->select_expedite( $file_handle );

  # Pause and resume write readiness watching.  These have lower
  # overhead than full select_write() calls.
  $kernel->select_pause_write( $file_handle );
  $kernel->select_resume_write( $file_handle );

  # Pause and resume read readiness watching.  These have lower
  # overhead than full select_read() calls.
  $kernel->select_pause_read( $file_handle );
  $kernel->select_resume_read( $file_handle );

  # Set and/or clear a combination of selects in one call.
  $kernel->select( $file_handle,
                   $read_event,     # or undef to clear it
                   $write_event,    # or undef to clear it
                   $expedite_event, # or undef to clear it
                   @optional_args,
                 );

Signal watcher and generator methods:

  # Watch for a signal, and generate an event when it arrives.
  $kernel->sig( $signal_name, $event );

  # Stop watching for a signal.
  $kernel->sig( $signal_name );

  # Handle a signal, preventing the program from terminating.
  $kernel->sig_handled();

  # Post a signal through POE rather than through the underlying OS.
  # This only works within the same process.
  $kernel->signal( $session, $signal_name, @optional_args );

State (event handler) management methods:

  # Remove an existing handler from the current Session.
  $kernel->state( $event_name );

  # Add a new inline handler, or replace an existing one.
  $kernel->state( $event_name, $code_reference );

  # Add a new object or package handler, or replace an existing
  # one. The object method will be the same as the eventname.
  $kernel->state( $event_name, $object_ref_or_package_name );

  # Add a new object or package handler, or replace an existing
  # one. The object method may be different from the event name.
  $kernel->state( $event_name, $object_ref_or_package_name, $method_name );

External reference count methods:

  # Increment a session's external reference count.
  $kernel->refcount_increment( $session_id, $refcount_name );

  # Decrement a session's external reference count.
  $kernel->refcount_decrement( $session_id, $refcount_name );

Kernel data accessors:

  # Return a reference to the currently active session, or to the
  # kernel if called outside any session.
  $session = $kernel->get_active_session();

  # Return the currently active event name, or an empty string if
  # called outside any event.
  $event = $kernel->get_active_event();

Exported symbols:

  # A reference to the global POE::Kernel instance.
  $poe_kernel

  # Some graphical toolkits (Tk) require at least one active widget in
  # order to use their event loops.  POE allocates a main window so it
  # can function when using one of these toolkits.
  $poe_main_window

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Kernel is an event application kernel.  It provides a
lightweight, cooperatively-timesliced process model in addition to the
usual basic event loop functions.

POE::Kernel cooperates with three external event loops.  This is
discussed after the public methods are described.

The POE manpage describes a shortcut for using several POE modules at
once.  It also includes a complete sample program with a brief
walkthrough of its parts.

=head1 PUBLIC KERNEL METHODS

This section discusses in more detail the POE::Kernel methods that
appear in the SYNOPSIS.

=head2 Kernel Management and Data Accessors

These functions manipulate the Kernel itself or retrieve information
from it.

=over 2

=item ID

ID() returns the kernel's unique identifier.

  print "The currently running Kernel is: $kernel->ID\n";

Every POE::Kernel instance is assigned an ID at birth.  This ID tries
to differentiate any given instance from all the others, even if they
exist on the same machine.  The ID is a hash of the machine's name and
the kernel's instantiation time and process ID.

  ~/perl/poe$ perl -wl -MPOE -e 'print $poe_kernel->ID'
  rocco.homenet-39240c97000001d8

=item run

run() starts the kernel's event loop.  It returns only after every
session has stopped, or immediately if no sessions have yet been
started.

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  use strict;
  use POE;

  # ... start bootstrap session(s) ...

  $poe_kernel->run();
  exit;

The run() method may be called on an instance of POE::Kernel.

  my $kernel = POE::Kernel->new();
  $kernel->run();

It may also be called as class method.

  POE::Kernel->run();

The run() method does not return a meaningful value.

=item run_one_timeslice

run_one_timeslice() checks for new events, which are enqueued, then
dispatches any events that were due at the time it was called.  Then
it returns.

It is often used to emulate blocking behavior for procedural code.

  my $done = 0;

  sub handle_some_event {
    $done = 1;
  }

  while (not $done) {
    $kernel->run_one_timeslice();
  }

Note: The above example will "spin" if POE::Kernel is done but $done
isn't set.

=item stop

stop() forcibly stops the kernel.  The event queue is emptied, all
resources are released, and all sessions are deallocated.
POE::Kernel's run() method returns as if everything ended normally,
which is a lie.

B<This function has a couple serious caveats.  Use it with caution.>

The session running when stop() is called will not fully destruct
until it returns.  If you think about it, there's at least a reference
to the session in its call stack, plus POE::Kernel is holding onto at
least one reference so it can invoke the session.

Sessions are not notified about their destruction.  If anything relies
on _stop being delivered, it will break and/or leak memory.

stop() has been added as an B<experimental> function to support
forking child kernels with POE::Wheel::Run.  We may remove it without
notice if it becomes really icky.  If you have good uses for it,
please mention them on POE's mailing list.

=back

=head2 FIFO Event Methods

FIFO events are dispatched in the order in which they were queued.
These methods queue new FIFO events.  A session will not spontaneously
stop as long as it has at least one FIFO event in the queue.

=over 2

=item post SESSION, EVENT_NAME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item post SESSION, EVENT_NAME

post() enqueues an event to be dispatched to EVENT_NAME in SESSION.
If a PARAMETER_LIST is included, its values will be passed as
arguments to EVENT_NAME's handler.

  $_[KERNEL]->post( $session, 'do_this' );
  $_[KERNEL]->post( $session, 'do_that', $with_this, $and_this );
  $_[KERNEL]->post( $session, 'do_that', @with_these );

  POE::Session->create(
    inline_states => {
      do_this => sub { print "do_this called with $_[ARG0] and $_[ARG1]\n" },
      do_that => sub { print "do_that called with @_[ARG0..$#_]\n" },
    }
  );

The post() method returns a boolean value indicating whether the event
was enqueued successfully.  $! will explain why the post() failed:

ESRCH: The SESSION did not exist at the time of the post() call.

Posted events keep both the sending and receiving session alive until
they're dispatched.

=item yield EVENT_NAME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item yield EVENT_NAME

yield() enqueues an EVENT_NAME event for the session that calls it.
If a PARAMETER_LIST is included, its values will be passed as
arguments to EVENT_NAME's handler.

yield() is shorthand for post() where the event's destination is the
current session.

Events posted with yield() must propagate through POE's FIFO before
they're dispatched.  This effectively yields timeslices to other
sessions which have events enqueued before it.

  $kernel->yield( 'do_this' );
  $kernel->yield( 'do_that', @with_these );

The previous yield() calls are equivalent to these post() calls.

  $kernel->post( $session, 'do_this' );
  $kernel->post( $session, 'do_that', @with_these );

The yield() method does not return a meaningful value.

=back

=head2 Synchronous Events

Sometimes it's necessary to invoke an event handler right away, for
example to handle a time-critical external event that would be spoiled
by the time an event propagated through POE's FIFO.  The kernel's
call() method provides for time-critical events.

=over 2

=item call SESSION, EVENT_NAME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item call SESSION, EVENT_NAME

call() bypasses the FIFO to call EVENT_NAME in a SESSION, optionally
with values from a PARAMETER_LIST.  The values will be passed as
arguments to EVENT_NAME at dispatch time.

call() returns whatever EVENT_NAME's handler does.  The call() call's
status is returned in $!, which is 0 for success or a nonzero reason
for failure.

  $return_value = $kernel->call( $session, 'do_this_now' );
  die "could not do_this_now: $!" if $!;

POE uses call() to dispatch some resource events without FIFO latency.
Filehandle watchers, for example, would continue noticing a handle's
readiness until it was serviced by a handler.  This could result in
several redundant readiness events being enqueued before the first one
was dispatched.

Reasons why call() might fail:

ESRCH: The SESSION did not exist at the time call() was called.

=back

=head2 Delayed Events (Original Interface)

POE also manages timed events.  These are events that should be
dispatched after at a certain time or after some time has elapsed.  A
session will not spontaneously stop as long as it has at least one
pending timed event.  Alarms and delays always are enqueued for the
current session, so a SESSION parameter is not needed.

The kernel manages two types of timed event.  Alarms are set to be
dispatched at a particular time, and delays are set to go off after a
certain interval.

If Time::HiRes is installed, POE::Kernel will use it to increase the
accuracy of timed events.  The kernel will use the less accurate
built-in time() if Time::HiRes isn't available.

If the use of Time::HiRes is not desired, for whatever reason, it can
be disabled like so:

    sub POE::Kernel::USE_TIME_HIRES () { 0 }
    use POE;

=over 2

=item alarm EVENT_NAME, EPOCH_TIME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item alarm EVENT_NAME, EPOCH_TIME

=item alarm EVENT_NAME

POE::Kernel's alarm() is a single-shot alarm.  It first clears all the
timed events destined for EVENT_NAME in the current session.  It then
may set a new alarm for EVENT_NAME if EPOCH_TIME is included,
optionally including values from a PARAMETER_LIST.

It is possible to post an alarm with an EPOCH_TIME in the past; in
that case, it will be placed towards the front of the event queue.

To clear existing timed events for 'do_this' and set a new alarm with
parameters:

  $kernel->alarm( 'do_this', $at_this_time, @with_these_parameters );

Clear existing timed events for 'do_that' and set a new alarm without
parameters:

  $kernel->alarm( 'do_that', $at_this_time );

To clear existing timed events for 'do_the_other_thing' without
setting a new delay:

  $kernel->alarm( 'do_the_other_thing' );

This method will clear all types of alarms without regard to how they
were set.

POE::Kernel's alarm() returns 0 on success or EINVAL if EVENT_NAME is
not defined.

=item alarm_add EVENT_NAME, EPOCH_TIME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item alarm_add EVENT_NAME, EPOCH_TIME

alarm_add() sets an additional timed event for EVENT_NAME in the
current session without clearing pending timed events.  The new alarm
event will be dispatched no earlier than EPOCH_TIME.

To enqueue additional alarms for 'do_this':

  $kernel->alarm_add( 'do_this', $at_this_time, @with_these_parameters );
  $kernel->alarm_add( 'do_this', $at_this_time );

Additional alarms can be cleared with POE::Kernel's alarm() method.

alarm_add() returns 0 on success or EINVAL if EVENT_NAME or EPOCH_TIME
is undefined.

=item delay EVENT_NAME, SECONDS, PARAMETER_LIST

=item delay EVENT_NAME, SECONDS

=item delay EVENT_NAME

delay() is a single-shot delayed event.  It first clears all the timed
events destined for EVENT_NAME in the current session.  If SECONDS is
included, it will set a new delay for EVENT_NAME to be dispatched
SECONDS seconds hence, optionally including values from a
PARAMETER_LIST.  Please note that delay()ed event are placed on the
queue and are thus asynchronous.

delay() uses whichever time(2) is available within POE::Kernel.  That
may be the more accurate Time::HiRes::time(), or perhaps not.
Regardless, delay() will do the right thing without sessions testing
for Time::HiRes themselves.

It's possible to post delays with negative SECONDS; in those cases,
they will be placed towards the front of the event queue.

To clear existing timed events for 'do_this' and set a new delay with
parameters:

  $kernel->delay( 'do_this', $after_this_much_time, @with_these );

Clear existing timed events for 'do_that' and set a new delay without
parameters:

  $kernel->delay( 'do_this', $after_this_much_time );

To clear existing timed events for 'do_the_other_thing' without
setting a new delay:

  $kernel->delay( 'do_the_other_thing' );

C<delay()> returns 0 on success or a reason for its failure: EINVAL if
EVENT_NAME is undefined.

=item delay_add EVENT_NAME, SECONDS, PARAMETER_LIST

=item delay_add EVENT_NAME, SECONDS

delay_add() sets an additional delay for EVENT_NAME in the current
session without clearing pending timed events.  The new delay will be
dispatched no sooner than SECONDS seconds hence.

To enqueue additional delays for 'do_this':

  $kernel->delay_add( 'do_this', $after_this_much_time, @with_these );
  $kernel->delay_add( 'do_this', $after_this_much_time );

Additional alarms can be cleared with POE::Kernel's delay() method.

delay_add() returns 0 on success or a reason for failure: EINVAL if
EVENT_NAME or SECONDS is undefined.

=head2 Delayed Events (June 2001 Interface)

These functions were finally added in June of 2001.  They manage
alarms and delays by unique IDs, allowing existing alarms to be moved
around, added, and removed with greater accuracy than the original
interface.

The June 2001 interface provides a different set of functions for
alarms, but their underlying semantics are the same.  Foremost, they
are always set for the current session.  That's why they don't require
a SESSION parameter.

For more information, see the previous section about the older alarms
interface.

=over 2

=item alarm_adjust ALARM_ID, DELTA

alarm_adjust adjusts an existing alarm by a number of seconds, the
DELTA, which may be positive or negative.  On success, it returns the
new absolute alarm time.

  # Move the alarm 10 seconds back in time.
  $new_time = $kernel->alarm_adjust( $alarm_id, -10 );

On failure, it returns false and sets $! to a reason for the failure.
That may be EINVAL if the alarm ID or the delta are bad values.  It
could also be ESRCH if the alarm doesn't exist (perhaps it already was
dispatched).  $! may also contain EPERM if the alarm doesn't belong to
the session trying to adjust it.

=item alarm_set EVENT_NAME, TIME, PARAMETER_LIST

=item alarm_set EVENT_NAME, TIME

Sets an alarm.  This differs from POE::Kernel's alarm() in that it
lets programs set alarms without clearing them.  Furthermore, it
returns an alarm ID which can be used in other new-style alarm
functions.

  $alarm_id = $kernel->alarm_set( party => 1000000000 )
  $kernel->alarm_remove( $alarm_id );

alarm_set sets $! and returns false if it fails.  $! will be EINVAL if
one of the function's parameters is bogus.

See: alarm_remove,

=item alarm_remove ALARM_ID

Removes an alarm from the current session, but first you must know its
ID.  The ID comes from a previous alarm_set() call, or you could hunt
at random for alarms to remove.

Upon success, alarm_remove() returns something true based on its
context.  In a list context, it returns three things: The removed
alarm's event name, its scheduled time, and a reference to the list of
parameters that were included with it.  This is all you need to
re-schedule the alarm later.

  my @old_alarm_list = $kernel->alarm_remove( $alarm_id );
  if (@old_alarm_list) {
    print "Old alarm event name: $old_alarm_list[0]\n";
    print "Old alarm time      : $old_alarm_list[1]\n";
    print "Old alarm parameters: @{$old_alarm_list[2]}\n";
  }
  else {
    print "Could not remove alarm $alarm_id: $!\n";
  }

In a scalar context, it returns a reference to a list of the three
things above.

  my $old_alarm_scalar = $kernel->alarm_remove( $alarm_id );
  if ($old_alarm_scalar) {
    print "Old alarm event name: $old_alarm_scalar->[0]\n";
    print "Old alarm time      : $old_alarm_scalar->[1]\n";
    print "Old alarm parameters: @{$old_alarm_scalar->[2]}\n";
  }
  else {
    print "Could not remove alarm $alarm_id: $!\n";
  }

Upon failure, it returns false and sets $! to the reason it failed.
$! may be EINVAL if the alarm ID is undefined, or it could be ESRCH if
no alarm was found by that ID.  It may also be EPERM if some other
session owns that alarm.

=item alarm_remove_all

alarm_remove_all() removes all alarms from the current session.  It
obviates the need for queue_peek_alarms(), which has been deprecated.

This function takes no arguments.  In scalar context, it returns a
reference to a list of alarms that were removed.  In list context, it
returns the list of removed alarms themselves.

Each removed alarm follows the same format as in alarm_remove().

  my @removed_alarms = $kernel->alarm_remove_all( );
  foreach my $alarm (@removed_alarms) {
    print "-----\n";
    print "Removed alarm event name: $alarm->[0]\n";
    print "Removed alarm time      : $alarm->[1]\n";
    print "Removed alarm parameters: @{$alarm->[2]}\n";
  }

  my $removed_alarms = $kernel->alarm_remove_all( );
  foreach my $alarm (@$removed_alarms) {
    ...;
  }

=item delay_set EVENT_NAME, SECONDS, PARAMETER_LIST

=item delay_set EVENT_NAME, SECONDS

delay_set() is a handy way to set alarms for a number of seconds
hence.  Its EVENT_NAME and PARAMETER_LIST are the same as for
alarm_set, and it returns the same things as alarm_set, both as a
result of success and of failure.

It's only difference is that SECONDS is added to the current time to
get the time the delay will be dispatched.  It uses whichever time()
POE::Kernel does, which may be Time::HiRes' high-resolution timer, if
that's available.

=item delay_adjust DELAY_ID, SECONDS

delay_adjust adjusts an existing delay to be a number of seconds in
the future.  It is useful for refreshing watchdog timers, for
instance.

  # Refresh a delay for 10 seconds into the future.
  $new_time = $kernel->delay_adjust( $delay_id, 10 );

On failure, it returns false and sets $! to a reason for the failure.
That may be EINVAL if the delay ID or the seconds are bad values.  It
could also be ESRCH if the delay doesn't exist (perhaps it already was
dispatched).  $! may also contain EPERM if the delay doesn't belong to
the session trying to adjust it.

=head2 Numeric Session IDs and Symbolic Session Names (Aliases)

Every session is given a unique ID at birth.  This ID combined with
the kernel's own ID can uniquely identify a particular session
anywhere in the world.

Sessions can also use the kernel's alias dictionary to give themselves
symbolic names.  Once a session has a name, it may be referred to by
that name wherever a kernel method expects a session reference or ID.

Sessions with aliases are treated as daemons within the current
program.  They are kept alive even without other things to do.  It's
assumed that they will receive events from some other session.

Aliases are passive work.  A session with just an alias to keep it
alive can't do anything if there isn't some other active session
around to send it messages.  POE knows this, and it will gladly kill
off aliased sessions if everything has become idle.  This prevents
"zombie" sessions from keeping an otherwise dead program running.

=over 2

=item alias_set ALIAS

alias_set() sets an ALIAS for the current session.  The ALIAS may then
be used nearly everywhere a session reference or ID is expected.
Sessions may have more than one alias, and each must be defined in a
separate alias_set() call.

  $kernel->alias_set( 'ishmael' ); # o/` A name I call myself. o/`

Aliases allow sessions to stay alive even when they may have nothing
to do.  Sessions can use them to become autonomous services that other
sessions refer to by name.

Aliases keep sessions alive as long as the program has work to do.  If
a program's remaining sessions are being kept alive solely by aliases,
they will be terminated.  This prevents running, the remaining
sessions will be terminated.  This prevents deadlocks where two or
more sessions are idly waiting for events from each other.

  $kernel->alias_set( 'httpd' );
  $kernel->post( httpd => set_handler => $uri_regexp => 'callback_event' );

alias_set() returns 0 on success, or a nonzero failure indicator:

=over 2

=item EEXIST

The alias already is assigned to a different session.

=back

=item alias_remove ALIAS

alias_remove() clears an existing ALIAS from the current session.  The
ALIAS will no longer refer to this session, and some other session may
claim it.

  $kernel->alias_remove( 'Shirley' ); # And don't call me Shirley.

If a session is only being kept alive by its aliases, it will stop
once they are removed.

alias_remove() returns 0 on success or a reason for its failure:

ESRCH: The Kernel's dictionary does not include the ALIAS being
removed.

EPERM: ALIAS belongs to some other session, and the current one does
not have the authority to clear it.

=item alias_resolve ALIAS

alias_resolve() returns a session reference corresponding to its given
ALIAS.  This method has been overloaded over time, and now ALIAS may
be several things:

An alias:

  $session_reference = $kernel->alias_resolve( 'irc_component' );

A stringified session reference.  This is a form of weak reference:

  $blessed_session_reference = $kernel->alias_resolve( "$stringified_one" );

A numeric session ID:

  $session_reference = $kernel->alias_resolve( $session_id );

alias_resolve() returns undef upon failure, setting $! to explain the
error:

ESRCH: The Kernel's dictionary does not include ALIAS.

These functions work directly with session IDs.  They are faster than
alias_resolve() in the specific cases where they're useful.

=item ID_id_to_session SESSION_ID

ID_id_to_session() returns a session reference for a given numeric
session ID.

  $session_reference = ID_id_to_session( $session_id );

It returns undef if a lookup fails, and it sets $! to explain why the
lookup failed:

ESRCH: The session ID does not refer to a running session.

=item alias_list SESSION

=item alias_list

alias_list() returns a list of alias(es) associated with a SESSION, or
with the current session if a SESSION is omitted.

SESSION may be a session reference (either blessed or stringified), a
session ID, or a session alias.  It will be resolved into a session
reference internally, and that will be used to locate the session's
aliases.

alias_list() returns a list of aliases associated with the session.
It returns an empty list if none were found.

=item ID_session_to_id SESSION_REFERENCE

ID_session_to_id() returns the ID associated with a session reference.
This is virtually identical to SESSION_REFERENCE->ID, except that
SESSION_REFERENCE may have been stringified.  For example, this will
work, provided that the session exists:

  $session_id = ID_session_to_id( "$session_reference" );

ID_session_to_id() returns undef if a lookup fails, and it sets $! to
explain why the lookup failed.

ESRCH: The session reference does not describe a session which is
currently running.

=back

=head2 Filehandle Watcher Methods (Selects)

Filehandle watchers emit events when files become available to be read
from or written to.  As of POE 0.1702 these events are queued along
with all the rest.  They are no longer "synchronous" or "immediate".

Filehandle watchers are often called "selects" in POE because they
were originally implemented with the select(2) I/O multiplexing
function.

File I/O event handlers are expected to interact with filehandles in a
way that causes them to stop being ready.  For example, a
select_read() event handler should try to read as much data from a
filehandle as it can.  The filehandle will stop being ready for
reading only when all its data has been read out.

Select events include two parameters.

C<ARG0> holds the handle of the file that is ready.

C<ARG1> contains 0, 1, or 2 to indicate whether the filehandle is
ready for reading, writing, or out-of-band reading (otherwise knows as
"expedited" or "exception").

C<ARG2..$#_> contain optional additional parameters passed to
POE::Kernel's various I/O watcher methods.

C<ARG0> and the other event handler parameter constants is covered in
L<POE::Session>.

Sessions will not stop if they have active filehandle watchers.

=over 2

=item select_read FILE_HANDLE, EVENT_NAME, ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS

=item select_read FILE_HANDLE, EVENT_NAME

=item select_read FILE_HANDLE

select_read() starts or stops the kernel from watching to see if a
filehandle can be read from.  An EVENT_NAME event will be enqueued
whenever the filehandle has data to be read.
The optional ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS will be passed to the input
callback after the usual I/O parameters.

  # Emit 'do_a_read' event whenever $filehandle has data to be read.
  $kernel->select_read( $filehandle, 'do_a_read' );

  # Stop watching for data to be read from $filehandle.
  $kernel->select_read( $filehandle );

select_read() does not return a meaningful value.

=item select_write FILE_HANDLE, EVENT_NAME

=item select_write FILE_HANDLE

select_write() starts or stops the kernel from watching to see if a
filehandle can be written to.  An EVENT_NAME event will be enqueued
whenever it is possible to write data to the filehandle.  The optional
ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS will be passed to the input callback after the
usual I/O parameters.

  # Emit 'flush_data' whenever $filehandle can be written to.
  $kernel->select_writ( $filehandle, 'flush_data' );

  # Stop watching for opportunities to write to $filehandle.
  $kernel->select_write( $filehandle );

select_write() does not return a meaningful value.

=item select_expedite FILE_HANDLE, EVENT_NAME

=item select_expedite FILE_HANDLE

select_expedite() starts or stops the kernel from watching to see if a
filehandle can be read from "out-of-band".  This is most useful for
datagram sockets where an out-of-band condition is meaningful.  In
most cases it can be ignored.  An EVENT_NAME event will be enqueued
whatever the filehandle can be read from out-of-band.  The optional
ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS will be passed to the input callback after the
usual I/O parameters.

Out of band data is called "expedited" because it's often available
ahead of a file or socket's normal data.  It's also used in socket
operations such as connect() to signal an exception.

  # Emit 'do_an_oob_read' whenever $filehandle has OOB data to be read.
  $kernel->select_expedite( $filehandle, 'do_an_oob_read' );

  # Stop watching for OOB data on the $filehandle.
  $kernel->select_expedite( $filehandle );

select_expedite() does not return a meaningful value.

=item select_pause_write FILE_HANDLE

=item select_resume_write FILE_HANDLE

select_pause_write() temporarily pauses event generation when a
FILE_HANDLE can be written to.  select_resume_write() turns event
generation back on.

These functions are more efficient than select_write() because they
don't perform full resource management.

Pause and resume a filehandle's writable events:

  $kernel->select_pause_write( $filehandle );
  $kernel->select_resume_write( $filehandle );

These methods don't return meaningful values.

=item select FILE_HANDLE, READ_EVENT, WRITE_EVENT, EXPEDITE_EVENT, ARGS

=item select FILE_HANDLE, READ_EVENT, WRITE_EVENT, EXPEDITE_EVENT

POE::Kernel's select() method alters a filehandle's read, write, and
expedite selects at the same time.  It's one method call more
expensive than doing the same thing manually, but it's more convenient
to code.

Defined event names set or change the events that will be emitted when
the filehandle becomes ready.  Undefined names clear those aspects of
the watcher, stopping it from generating those types of events.

This sets all three types of events at once.

  $kernel->select( $filehandle, 'do_read', 'do_flush', 'do_read_oob' );

This clears all three types of events at once.  If this filehandle is
the only thing keeping a session alive, then clearing its selects will
stop the session.

  $kernel->select( $filehandle );

This sets up a filehandle for read-only operation.

  $kernel->select( $filehandle, 'do_read', undef, 'do_read_oob' );

This sets up a filehandle for write-only operation.

  $kernel->select( $filehandle, undef, 'do_flush' );

This method does not return a meaningful value.

=back

=head2 Signal Watcher Methods

First some general notes about signal events and handling them.

Sessions only receive signal events that have been registered with
C<sig()>.  In the past, they also would receive "_signal" events, but
this is no longer the case.

Child sessions are the ones created by another session.  Signals are
dispatched to children before their parents.  By the time a parent
receives a signal, all its children have already had a chance to
handle it.

The Kernel acts as the parent of every session.  Signaling it causes
every interested session to receive the signal.  This is how operating
system signals are implemented.

It is possible to post signals in POE that don't exist in the
operating system.  They are placed into the queue as if they came from
the operating system, but they are not limited to signals recognized
by kill().  POE uses a few of these "fictitious" signals to notify
programs about certain global events.

It is also possible to post signals to particular sessions.  In those
cases, POE only calls the handlers for that session and its children.

Some signals are considered terminal.  They will terminate the
sessions they touch if they are not marked as "handled".  A signal is
considered handled (or not) for all the sessions it touches.
Therefore, one session can handle a signal for the entire program.
All the other sessions will still receive notice of the signal, but
none of them will be terminated if it's handled by the time it's fully
dispatched.

The sig_handled() method is used to mark signals as handled.

POE also recognizes "non-maskable" signals.  These will terminate a
program even when they are handled.  For example, POE sends a
non-maskable UIDESTROY signal to indicate when the program's user
interface has been shut down.

Signal handling in older versions of Perl is not safe by itself.  POE
is written to avoid as many signal problems as it can, but they still
may occur.  SIGCHLD is a special exception: POE polls for child
process exits using waitpid() instead of a signal handler.  Spawning
child processes should be completely safe.

Here is a summary of the three signal levels.

=over 2

=item benign

Benign signals just notify sessions that signals have been received.
They have no side effects if they are not handled.

=item terminal

Terminal signal may stop a program if they go unhandled.  If any event
handler calls C<sig_handled()>, however, then the program will
continue to live.

The terminal system signals are: HUP, INT, KILL, QUIT and TERM.  There
are two terminal fictitious signals, IDLE and DIE. IDLE is used to notify
leftover sessions when a program has run out of things to do. DIE is
used to notify sessions that an exception has occurred.

POE's automatic exception handling can be turned off by setting the
C<CATCH_EXCEPTIONS> constant subroutine in C<POE::Kernel> to 0 like so:

  sub POE::Kernel::CATCH_EXCEPTIONS () { 0 }


=item nonmaskable

Nonmaskable signals are similar to terminal signals, but they stop a
program regardless whether it has been handled.  POE implements two
nonmaskable signals, both of which are fictitious.

ZOMBIE is fired if the terminal signal IDLE did not wake anything up.
It is used to stop the remaining "zombie" sessions so that an inactive
program will exit cleanly.

UIDESTROY is fired when a main or top-level user interface widget has
been destroyed.  It is used to shut down programs when their
interfaces have been closed.

=back

Some system signals are handled specially.  These are SIGCHLD/SIGCLD,
SIGPIPE, and SIGWINCH.

=over 2

=item SIGCHLD/SIGCLD Events

SIGCHLD and SIGCLD both indicate that a child process has terminated.
The signal name varies from one operating system to another.
POE::Kernel always sends the program a CHLD signal, regardless of the
operating system's name for it.  This simplifies your code since you
don't need to check for both.

The SIGCHLD/SIGCHLD signal event comes with three custom parameters.

C<ARG0> contains 'CHLD', even if SIGCLD was caught.
C<ARG1> contains the ID of the exiting child process.
C<ARG2> contains the return value from C<$?>.

=item SIGPIPE Events

Normally, system signals are posted to the Kernel so they can
propagate to every session.  SIGPIPE is an exception to this rule.  It
is posted to the session that is currently running.  It still will
propagate through that session's children, but it will not go beyond
that parent/child tree.

SIGPIPE is mostly moot since POE will usually return an EPIPE error
instead.

=item SIGWINCH Events

Window resizes can generate a large number of signals very quickly,
and this can easily cause perl to dump core.  This should not be a
problem in newer versions of Perl (after 5.8.0) because they make
signals safe for the world.

The Event module also claims to handle signals safely.  Its signal
handlers are written in C++, and they can do more interesting things
than plain Perl handlers.

=back

Finally, here are POE::Kernel's signal methods themselves.

=over 2

=item sig SIGNAL_NAME, EVENT_NAME

=item sig SIGNAL_NAME

sig() registers or unregisters a EVENT_NAME event for a particular
SIGNAL_NAME.  Signal names are the same as %SIG uses, with one
exception: CLD is always delivered as CHLD, so handling CHLD will
always do the right thing.

  $kernel->sig( INT => 'event_sigint' );

To unregister a signal handler, just leave off the event it should
generate, or pass it in undefined.

  $kernel->sig( 'INT' );
  $kernel->sig( INT => undef );

It's possible to register events for signals that the operating system
will never generate.  These "fictitious" signals can however be
generated through POE's signal() method instead of kill(2).

The sig() method does not return a meaningful value.

=item sig_handled

sig_handled() informs POE that a signal was handled.  It is only
meaningful within event handlers that are triggered by signals.

=item signal SESSION, SIGNAL_NAME, OPTIONAL_ARGS

=item signal SESSION, SIGNAL_NAME

signal() posts a signal event to a particular session (and its
children) through POE::Kernel rather than actually signaling the
process through the operating system.  Because it injects signal
events directly into POE's Kernel, its SIGNAL_NAME doesn't have to be
one the operating system understands.

For example, this posts a fictitious signal to some session:

  $kernel->signal( $session, 'DIEDIEDIE' );

POE::Kernel's signal() method doesn't return a meaningful value.

=item signal_ui_destroy WIDGET

This registers a widget with POE::Kernel such that the Kernel fires a
UIDESTROY signal when the widget is closed or destroyed.  The exact
trigger depends on the graphical toolkit currently being used.

  # Fire a UIDESTROY signal when this top-level window is deleted.
  $heap->{gtk_toplevel_window} = Gtk::Window->new('toplevel');
  $kernel->signal_ui_destroy( $heap->{gtk_toplevel_window} );

=back

L<POE::Session> also discusses signal events.

=head2 Session Management Methods

These methods manage sessions.

=over 2

=item detach_child SESSION

Detaches SESSION from the current session.  SESSION must be a child of
the current session, or this call will fail.  detach_child() returns 1
on success.  If it fails, it returns false and sets $! to one of the
following values:

ESRCH indicates that SESSION is not a valid session.

EPERM indicates that SESSION is not a child of the current session.

This call may generate corresponding _parent and/or _child events.
See PREDEFINED EVENT NAMES in POE::Session's manpage for more
information about _parent and _child events.

=item detach_myself

Detaches the current session from it parent.  The parent session stops
owning the current one.  The current session is instead made a child
of POE::Kernel.  detach_child() returns 1 on success.  If it fails, it
returns 0 and sets $! to EPERM to indicate that the current session
already is a child of POE::Kernel and cannot be detached from it.

This call may generate corresponding _parent and/or _child events.
See PREDEFINED EVENT NAMES in POE::Session's manpage for more
information about _parent and _child events.

=back

=head2 State Management Methods

State management methods let sessions hot swap their event handlers.
It would be rude to change another session's handlers, so these
methods only affect the current one.

=over 2

=item state EVENT_NAME

=item state EVENT_NAME, CODE_REFERENCE

=item state EVENT_NAME, OBJECT_REFERENCE

=item state EVENT_NAME, OBJECT_REFERENCE, OBJECT_METHOD_NAME

=item state EVENT_NAME, PACKAGE_NAME

=item state EVENT_NAME, PACKAGE_NAME, PACKAGE_METHOD_NAME

Depending on how it's used, state() can add, remove, or update an
event handler in the current session.

The simplest form of state() call deletes a handler for an event.
This example removes the current session's "do_this" handler.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this' );

The next form assigns a coderef to an event.  If the event is already
being handled, its old handler will be discarded.  Any events already
in POE's queue will be dispatched to the new handler.

Plain coderef handlers are also called "inline" handlers because they
originally were defined with inline anonymous subs.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this', \&this_does_it );

The third and fourth forms register or replace a handler with an
object method.  These handlers are called "object states" or object
handlers.  The third form maps an event to a method with the same
name.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this', $with_this_object );

The fourth form maps an event to a method with a different name.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this', $with_this_object, $calling_this_method );

The fifth and sixth forms register or replace a handler with a package
method.  These handlers are called "package states" or package
handlers.  The fifth form maps an event to a function with the same
name.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this', $with_this_package );

The sixth form maps an event to a function with a different name.

  $kernel->state( 'do_this', $with_this_package, $calling_this_function );

POE::Kernel's state() method returns 0 on success or a nonzero code
explaining why it failed:

ESRCH: The Kernel doesn't recognize the currently active session.
This happens when state() is called when no session is active.

=back

=head2 External Reference Count Methods

The Kernel internally maintains reference counts on sessions that have
active resource watchers.  The reference counts are used to ensure
that a session doesn't self-destruct while it's doing something
important.

POE::Kernel's external reference counting methods let resource watcher
developers manage their own reference counts.  This lets the watchers
keep their sessions alive when necessary.

=over 2

=item refcount_increment SESSION_ID, REFCOUNT_NAME

=item refcount_decrement SESSION_ID, REFCOUNT_NAME

refcount_increment() increments a session's external reference count,
returning the reference count after the increment.

refcount_decrement() decrements a session's external reference count,
returning the reference count after the decrement.

  $new_count = $kernel->refcount_increment( $session_id, 'thingy' );
  $new_count = $kernel->refcount_decrement( $session_id, 'thingy' );

Both methods return undef on failure and set $! to explain the
failure.

ESRCH: There is no session SESSION_ID currently active.

=back

=head2 Kernel Data Accessors

The Kernel keeps some information which can be useful to other
libraries.  These functions provide a consistent, safe interface to
the Kernel's internal data.

=over 2

=item get_active_session

get_active_session() returns a reference to the session which is
currently running.  It returns a reference to the Kernel itself if no
other session is running.  This is one of the times where the Kernel
pretends it's just another session.

  my $active_session = $poe_kernel->get_active_session();

This is a convenient way for procedurally called libraries to get a
reference to the current session.  Otherwise a programmer would
tediously need to include C<SESSION> with every call.

=item get_active_event

get_active_event() returns the currently active event name or an
empty string if called outside any event.

=back

=head1 Using POE with Other Event Loops

POE::Kernel supports any number of event loops.  Four are included in
the base distribution, and others are available on the CPAN.  POE's
public interfaces remain the same regardless of the event loop being
used.

There are three ways to load an alternate event loop.  The simplest is
to load the event loop before loading POE::Kernel.  Remember that POE
loads POE::Kernel internally.

  use Gtk;
  use POE;

POE::Kernel detects that Gtk has been loaded, and it loads the
appropriate internal code to use it.

You can also specify which loop to load directly.  Event loop bridges
are named "POE::Loop::$loop_module", where $loop_module is the name of
the module, with "::" translated to underscores.  For example:

  use POE qw( Loop::Event_Lib );

would load POE::Loop::Event_Lib (which may or may not be on CPAN).

If you'd rather use POE::Kernel directly, it has a different import
syntax:

  use POE::Kernel { loop => "Tk" };

The four event loops included in POE's distribution:

POE's default select() loop.  It is included so at least something
will work on any given platform.

Event.pm.  This provides compatibility with other modules requiring
Event's loop.  It may also introduce safe signals in versions of Perl
prior to 5.8, should you need them.

Gtk and Tk event loops.  These are included to support graphical
toolkits.  Others are on the CPAN, including Gtk2 and hopefully WxPerl
soon.  When using Tk with POE, POE supplies an already-created
$poe_main_window variable to use for your main window.  Calling Tk's
MainWindow->new() often has an undesired outcome.

IO::Poll.  This is potentially more efficient than POE's default
select() code in large scale clients and servers.

Many external event loops expect plain coderefs as callbacks.
POE::Session has postback() and callback() methods that create
callbacks suitable for external event loops.  In turn, they post() or
call() POE event handlers.

=head2 Kernel's Debugging Features

POE::Kernel contains a number of assertion and tracing flags.  They
were originally created to debug POE::Kernel itself, but they are also
useful for tracking down other problems.

Assertions are the quiet ones.  They only create output when something
catastrophic has happened.  That output is almost always fatal.  They
are mainly used to check the sanity of POE's internal data structures.

Traces are assertions' annoying cousins.  They noisily report on the
status of a running POE::Kernel instance, but they are never fatal.

Assertions and traces incur performance penalties when enabled.  It's
probably a bad idea to enable them in live systems.  They are all
disabled by default.

Assertion and tracing flags can be defined before POE::Kernel is first
used.

  # Turn on everything.
  sub POE::Kernel::ASSERT_DEFAULT () { 1 }
  sub POE::Kernel::TRACE_DEFAULT  () { 1 }
  use POE;  # Includes POE::Kernel

It is also possible to enable them using shell environment variables.
The environment variables follow the same names as the constants in
this section, but "POE_" is prepended to them.

  POE_ASSERT_DEFAULT=1 POE_TRACE_DEFAULT=1 ./my_poe_program

Assertions will be discussed first.

=item ASSERT_DATA

ASSERT_DATA enables a variety of runtime integrity checks within
POE::Kernel and its event loop bridges.  This can impose a significant
runtime penalty, so it is off by default.  The test programs for POE
all enable ASSERT_DEFAULT, which includes ASSERT_DATA.

=item ASSERT_DEFAULT

ASSERT_DEFAULT is used as the default value for all the other assert
constants.  Setting it true is a quick and reliable way to ensure all
assertions are enabled.

=item ASSERT_EVENTS

ASSERT_EVENTS enables checks for dispatching events to nonexistent
sessions.

=item ASSERT_FILES

ASSERT_FILES enables some runtime checks on the file multiplexing
syscalls used to drive POE.

=item ASSERT_RETVALS

ASSERT_RETVALS causes POE::Kernel to die if a method would return an
error.  See also TRACE_RETVALS if you want a runtime warning rather
than a hard error.

=item ASSERT_USAGE

ASSERT_USAGE enables runtime parameter checking in a lot of
POE::Kernel method calls.  These are disabled by default because they
impart a hefty performance penalty.

=back

Then there are the trace options.

=over 2

=item TRACE_DEFAULT

TRACE_DEFAULT is used as the default value for all the other trace
constants.  Setting it true is a quick and reliable way to ensure all
traces are enabled.

=item TRACE_DESTROY

Enable TRACE_DESTROY to receive a dump of the contents of Session
heaps when they finally DESTROY.  It is indispensable for finding
memory leaks, which often hide in Session heaps.

=item TRACE_EVENTS

The music goes around and around, and it comes out here.  TRACE_EVENTS
enables messages that tell what happens to FIFO and alarm events: when
they're queued, dispatched, or discarded, and what their handlers
return.

=item TRACE_FILENAME

By default, trace messages go to STDERR.  If you'd like them to go
elsewhere, set TRACE_FILENAME to the file where they should go.

=item TRACE_FILES

TRACE_FILES enables or disables messages that tell how files are being
processed within POE::Kernel and the event loop bridges.

=item TRACE_STATISTICS

B<This feature is experimental.  No doubt it will change.>

TRACE_STATISTICS enables runtime gathering and reporting of various
performance metrics within a POE program.  Some statistics include how
much time is spent processing event callbacks, time spent in POE's
dispatcher, and the time spent waiting for an event.  A report is
displayed just before run() returns, and the data can be retrieved at
any time using stat_getdata().

stat_getdata() returns a hashref of various statistics and their
values.  The statistics are calculated using a sliding window and vary
over time as a program runs.

=item TRACE_PROFILE

TRACE_PROFILE switches on event profiling.  This causes the Kernel to
keep a count of every event it dispatches.  A report of the events and
their frequencies is displayed just before run() returns, or at
any time via stat_show_profile().

=item TRACE_REFCNT

TRACE_REFCNT displays messages about reference counts for sessions,
including garbage collection tests (formerly TRACE_GARBAGE).  This is
perhaps the most useful debugging trace since it will explain why
sessions do or don't die.

=item TRACE_RETVALS

TRACE_RETVALS enables carping whenever a Kernel method is about to
return an error.  See ASSERT_RETVALS if you would like the Kernel to
be stricter than this.

=item TRACE_SESSIONS

TRACE_SESSIONS enables messages pertaining to session management.
These messages include notice when sessions are created or destroyed.
They also include parent and child relationship changes.

=item TRACE_SIGNALS

TRACE_SIGNALS enables or disables information about signals caught and
dispatched within POE::Kernel.

=back

=head1 POE::Kernel Exports

POE::Kernel exports two symbols for your coding enjoyment:
C<$poe_kernel> and C<$poe_main_window>.  POE::Kernel is implicitly
used by POE itself, so using POE gets you POE::Kernel (and its
exports) for free.

=over 2

=item $poe_kernel

$poe_kernel contains a reference to the process' POE::Kernel instance.
It's mainly useful for getting at the kernel from places other than
event handlers.

For example, programs can't call the Kernel's run() method without a
reference, and they normally don't get references to the Kernel
without being in a running event handler.  This gets them going:

  $poe_kernel->run();

It's also handy from within libraries, but event handlers themselves
receive C<KERNEL> parameters and don't need to use $poe_kernel
directly.

=item $poe_main_window

Some graphical toolkits (currently only Tk) require at least one
widget be created before their event loops are usable.  POE::Kernel
allocates a main window in these cases, and exports a reference to
that window in C<$poe_main_window>.  For all other toolkits, this
exported variable is undefined.

Programs are free to use C<$poe_main_window> for whatever needs.  They
may even assign a widget to it when using toolkits that don't require
an initial widget (Gtk for now).

$poe_main_window is undefined if a graphical toolkit isn't used.

There is no mechanism in place to prevent external reference count
names from clashing.

Probably lots more.
