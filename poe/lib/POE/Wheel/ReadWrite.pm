=head1 NAME

POE::Wheel::ReadWrite - buffered non-blocking I/O

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  $wheel = POE::Wheel::ReadWrite->new(

    # To read and write from the same handle, such as a socket, use
    # the Handle parameter:
    Handle       => $file_or_socket_handle,  # Handle to read/write

    # To read and write from different handles, such as a dual pipe to
    # a child process, or a console, use InputHandle and OutputHandle:
    InputHandle  => $readable_filehandle,    # Handle to read
    OutputHandle => $writable_filehandle,    # Handle to write

    Driver       => POE::Driver::Something->new(), # How to read/write it

    # To read and write using the same line discipline, such as
    # Filter::Line, use the Filter parameter:
    Filter       => POE::Filter::Something->new(), # How to parse in and out

    # To read and write using different line disciplines, such as
    # stream out and line in:
    InputFilter  => POE::Filter::Something->new(),     # Read data one way
    OutputFilter => POE::Filter::SomethingElse->new(), # Write data another

    InputEvent   => $input_event_name,  # Input received event
    FlushedEvent => $flush_event_name,  # Output flushed event
    ErrorEvent   => $error_event_name,  # Error occurred event

    # To enable callbacks for high and low water events (using any one
    # of these options requires the rest):
    HighMark  => $high_mark_octets, # Outgoing high-water mark
    HighEvent => $high_mark_event,  # Event to emit when high-water reached
    LowMark   => $low_mark_octets,  # Outgoing low-water mark
    LowEvent  => $low_mark_event,   # Event to emit when low-water reached
  );

  $wheel->put( $something );
  $wheel->event( ... );

  # To set both the input and output filters at once:
  $wheel->set_filter( POE::Filter::Something->new() );

  # To set an input filter or an output filter:
  $wheel->set_input_filter( POE::Filter::Something->new() );
  $wheel->set_output_filter( POE::Filter::Something->new() );

  # To alter the high or low water marks:
  $wheel->set_high_mark( $new_high_mark_octets );
  $wheel->set_low_mark( $new_low_mark_octets );

  # To fetch driver statistics:
  $pending_octets   = $wheel->get_driver_out_octets();
  $pending_messages = $wheel->get_driver_out_messages();

  # To retrieve the wheel's ID:
  print $wheel->ID;

  # To pause and resume a wheel's input events.
  $wheel->pause_input();
  $wheel->resume_input();

  # To shutdown a wheel's socket(s).
  $wheel->shutdown_input();
  $wheel->shutdown_output();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ReadWrite performs buffered, select-based I/O on filehandles.  It
generates events for common file conditions, such as when data has
been read or flushed.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=over 2

=item put LISTREF_OF_RECORDS

put() queues records for transmission.  They may not be transmitted
immediately.  ReadWrite uses its Filter to translate the records into
a form suitable for writing.  It uses its Driver to queue and send
them.

put() accepts a list of records.  It returns a boolean value
indicating whether the wheel's high-water mark has been reached.  It
always returns false if a wheel doesn't have a high-water mark set.

This will quickly fill a wheel's output queue if it has a high-water
mark set.  Otherwise it will loop infinitely, eventually exhausting
memory.

  1 while $wheel->put( &get_next_thing_to_send );

=item event EVENT_TYPE => EVENT_NAME, ...

event() is covered in the POE::Wheel manpage.

=item set_filter POE_FILTER

=item set_input_filter POE_FILTER

=item set_output_filter POE_FILTER

set_input_filter() changes the filter a wheel uses for reading.
set_output_filter() changes a wheel's output filter.  set_filter()
changes them both at once.

These methods let programs change a wheel's underlying protocol while
it runs.  It retrieves the existing filter's unprocessed input using
its get_pending() method and passes that to the new filter.

Switching filters can be tricky.  Please see the discussion of
get_pending() in L<POE::Filter>.

The HTTPD filter does not support get_pending(), and it will complain
if a program tries to switch away from one.

=item get_input_filter

=item get_output_filter

Return the wheel's input or output filter.  In many cases, they both
may be the same.  This is used to access custom methods on the filter
itself; for example, Filter::Stackable has methods to push and pop
filters on its stack.

  $wheel->get_input_filter()->pop();

=item set_high_mark HIGH_MARK_OCTETS

=item set_low_mark LOW_MARK_OCTETS

These methods set a wheel's high- and low-water marks.  New values
will not take effect until the next put() call or internal buffer
flush.  The event() method can change the events emitted by high- and
low-water marks.

=item ID

The ID method returns a ReadWrite wheel's unique ID.  This ID will be
included in every event the wheel generates, and it can be used to
match events with the wheels which generated them.

=item pause_input

=item resume_input

ReadWrite wheels will continually generate input events for as long as
they have data to read.  Sometimes it's necessary to control the flow
of data coming from a wheel or the input filehandle it manages.

pause_input() instructs the wheel to temporarily stop checking its
input filehandle for data.  This can keep a session (or a
corresponding output buffer) from being overwhelmed.

resume_input() instructs the wheel to resume checking its input
filehandle for data.

=item shutdown_input

=item shutdown_output

Some applications require the remote end to shut down a socket before
they will continue.  These methods map directly to shutdown() for the
wheel's input and output sockets.

=head1 EVENTS AND PARAMETERS

=over 2

=item Driver

Driver is a POE::Driver subclass that is used to read from and write
to ReadWrite's filehandle(s).  It encapsulates the low-level I/O
operations so in theory ReadWrite never needs to know about them.

Driver defaults to C<<POE::Driver::SysRW->new()>>.

=item Filter

Filter is a POE::Filter subclass that's used to parse incoming data
and create streamable outgoing data.  It encapsulates the lowest level
of a protocol so in theory ReadWrite never needs to know about them.

Filter defaults to C<<POE::Filter::Line->new()>>.

=item InputEvent

InputEvent contains the event that the wheel emits for every complete
record read.  Every InputEvent is accompanied by two parameters.
C<ARG0> contains the record which was read.  C<ARG1> contains the
wheel's unique ID.

The wheel will not attempt to read from its Handle or InputHandle if
InputEvent is omitted.

A sample InputEvent handler:

  sub input_state {
    my ($heap, $input, $wheel_id) = @_[HEAP, ARG0, ARG1];
    print "Echoing input from wheel $wheel_id: $input\n";
    $heap->{wheel}->put($input);     # Echo it back.
  }

=item FlushedEvent

FlushedEvent contains the event that ReadWrite emits whenever its
output queue becomes empty.  This signals that all pending data has
been written, and it's often used to wait for "goodbye" messages to be
sent before a session shuts down.

FlushedEvent comes with a single parameter, C<ARG0>, that indicates
which wheel flushed its buffer.

A sample FlushedEvent handler:

  sub flushed_state {
    # Stop a wheel after all outgoing data is flushed.
    # This frees the wheel's resources, including the
    # filehandle, and closes the connection.
    delete $_[HEAP]->{wheel}->{$_[ARG0]};
  }

=item ErrorEvent

ErrorEvent contains the event that ReadWrite emits whenever an error
occurs.  Every ErrorEvent comes with four parameters:

C<ARG0> contains the name of the operation that failed.  This usually
is 'read'.  Note: This is not necessarily a function name.  The wheel
doesn't know which function its Driver is using.

C<ARG1> and C<ARG2> hold numeric and string values for C<$!>,
respectively.

C<ARG3> contains the wheel's unique ID.

A sample ErrorEvent handler:

  sub error_state {
    my ($operation, $errnum, $errstr, $wheel_id) = @_[ARG0..ARG3];
    warn "Wheel $wheel_id generated $operation error $errnum: $errstr\n";
    delete $heap->{wheels}->{$wheel_id}; # shut down that wheel
  }

=item HighEvent

=item LowEvent

ReadWrite emits a HighEvent when a wheel's pending output queue has
grown to be at least HighMark octets.  A LowEvent is emitted when a
wheel's pending octet count drops below the value of LowMark.

HighEvent and LowEvent flip-flop.  Once a HighEvent has been emitted,
it won't be emitted again until a LowEvent is emitted.  Likewise,
LowEvent will not be emitted again until HighEvent is.  ReadWrite
always starts in a low-water state.

Sessions which stream output are encouraged to use these events for
flow control.  Sessions can reduce their transmission rates or stop
transmitting altogether upon receipt of a HighEvent, and they can
resume full-speed transmission once LowEvent arrives.
