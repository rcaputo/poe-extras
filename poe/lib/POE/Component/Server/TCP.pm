=head1 DESCRIPTION

The TCP server component hides a generic TCP server pattern.  It uses
POE::Wheel::SocketFactory and POE::Wheel::ReadWrite internally,
creating a new session for each connection to arrive.

The authors hope that generic servers can be created with as little
work as possible.  Servers with uncommon requirements may need to be
written using the wheel classes directly.  That isn't terribly
difficult.  A tutorial at http://poe.perl.org/ describes how.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR PARAMETERS

The new() method can accept quite a lot of parameters.  It always
returns undef, however.  One must use callbacks to check for errors
rather than the return value of new().

POE::Component::Server::TCP supplies common defaults for most
callbacks and handlers.

=over 2

=item Acceptor => CODEREF

Acceptor sets a mostly obsolete callback that is expected to create
the connection sessions manually.  Most programs should use the
/^Client/ callbacks instead.

The coderef receives its parameters directly from SocketFactory's
SuccessEvent.  ARG0 is the accepted socket handle, suitable for giving
to a ReadWrite wheel.  ARG1 and ARG2 contain the packed remote address
and numeric port, respectively.  ARG3 is the SocketFactory wheel's ID.

  Acceptor => \&accept_handler

Acceptor lets programmers rewrite the guts of Server::TCP entirely.
It is not compatible with the /^Client/ callbacks.

=item Address => SCALAR

Address is the optional interface address the TCP server will bind to.
It defaults to INADDR_ANY or INADDR6_ANY when using IPv4 or IPv6,
respectively.

  Address => '127.0.0.1'   # Localhost IPv4
  Address => "::1"         # Localhost IPv6

It's passed directly to SocketFactory's BindAddress parameter, so it
can be in whatever form SocketFactory supports.  At the time of this
writing, that's a dotted quad, an IPv6 address, a host name, or a
packed Internet address. See also the Hostname parameter.

=item Alias => SCALAR

Alias is an optional name by which the server's listening session will
be known.  Messages sent to the alias will go to the listening
session, not the sessions that are handling active connections.

  Alias => 'chargen'

Later on, the 'chargen' service can be shut down with:

  $kernel->post( chargen => 'shutdown' );

=item Args => ARRAYREF

Args passes the contents of a ARRAYREF to the ClientConnected callback
via @_[ARG0..$#_].  It allows you to send extra information to the
sessions that handle each client connection.

=item ClientConnected => CODEREF

ClientConnected sets the callback used to notify each new client
session that it is started.  ClientConnected callbacks receive the
usual POE parameters, plus a copy of whatever was specified in the
component's C<Args> constructor parameter.

The ClientConnected callback will not be called within the same
session context twice.

=item ClientDisconnected => CODEREF

ClientDisconnected sets the callback used to notify a client session
that the client has disconnected.

ClientDisconnected callbacks receive the usual POE parameters, but
nothing special is included.

=item ClientError => CODEREF

ClientError sets the callback used to notify a client session that
there has been an error on the connection.

It receives POE's usual error handler parameters: ARG0 is the name of
the function that failed.  ARG1 is the numeric failure code ($! in
numeric context).  ARG2 is the string failure code ($! in string
context), and so on.

POE::Wheel::ReadWrite discusses the error parameters in more detail.

A default error handler will be provided if ClientError is omitted.
The default handler will log most errors to STDERR.

The value of ClientShutdownOnError determines whether the connection
will be shutdown after errors are received.  It is the client
shutdown, not the error, that invokes ClientDisconnected callbacks.

=item ClientFilter => SCALAR

=item ClientFilter => ARRAYREF

ClientFilter specifies the type of filter that will parse input from
each client, and optionally any constructor arguments used to create
each filter instance.

It takes a POE::Filter class name rather than an object because the
component must create a new instance for each connection.

If ClientFilter contains a SCALAR, it defines the name of the
POE::Filter class.  Default constructor parameters will be used to
create instances of that filter.

  ClientFilter => "POE::Filter::Stream",

If ClientFilter contains a list reference, the first item in the list
will be a POE::Filter class name, and the remaining items will be
constructor parameters for the filter.  For example, this changes the
line separator to a vertical bar:

  ClientFilter => [ "POE::Filter::Line", Literal => "|" ],

ClientFilter is optional.  The component will use "POE::Filter::Line"
if it is omitted.

If you supply a different value for Filter, then you must also C<use>
that filter class.

=item ClientInputFilter => SCALAR

=item ClientInputFilter => ARRAYREF

=item ClientOutputFilter => SCALAR

=item ClientOutputFilter => ARRAYREF

ClientInputFilter and ClientOutputFilter act like ClientFilter, but
they allow programs to specify different filters for input and output.
Both must be used together.

Usage is the same as ClientFilter.

  ClientInputFilter  => [ "POE::Filter::Line", Literal => "|" ],
  ClientOutputFilter => "POE::Filter::Stream",

=item ClientInput => CODEREF

ClientInput sets a callback that will be called to handle client
input.  The callback receives its parameters directly from ReadWrite's
InputEvent.  ARG0 is the input record, and ARG1 is the wheel's unique
ID, and so on.  POE::Wheel::ReadWrite discusses input event handlers
in more detail.

  ClientInput => \&input_handler

ClientInput and Acceptor are mutually exclusive.  Enabling one
prohibits the other.

=item ClientShutdownOnError => BOOLEAN

ClientShutdownOnError tells the component whether to shut down client
sessions automatically on errors.  It defaults to true.  Setting it to
a false value (0, undef, "") turns this feature off.

If this option is turned off, it becomes your responsibility to deal
with client errors properly.  Not handling them, or not destroying
wheels when they should be, will cause the component to spit out a
constant stream of errors, eventually bogging down your application
with dead connections that spin out of control.

You've been warned.

=item Domain => SCALAR

Specifies the domain within which communication will take place.  It
selects the protocol family which should be used.  Currently supported
values are AF_INET, AF_INET6, PF_INET or PF_INET6.  This parameter is
optional and will default to AF_INET if omitted.

Note: AF_INET6 and PF_INET6 are supplied by the Socket6 module, which
is available on the CPAN.  You must have Socket6 loaded before
POE::Component::Server::TCP will create IPv6 sockets.

=item Error => CODEREF

Error sets the callback that will be invoked when the server socket
reports an error.  The callback is used to handle
POE::Wheel::SocketFactory's FailureEvent, so it receives the same
parameters as discussed there.

A default error handler will be provided if Error is omitted.  The
default handler will log the error to STDERR and shut down the server.
Active connections will have the opportunity to complete their
transactions.

=item Hostname => SCALAR

Hostname is the optional non-packed name of the interface the TCP
server will bind to. This will always be converted via inet_aton
and so can either be a dotted quad or a name. If you know that you
are passing in text, then this parameter should be used in preference
to Address, to prevent confusion in the case that the hostname
happens to be 4 bytes in length. In the case that both are
provided, then the Address parameter overrides
the Hostname parameter.

=item InlineStates => HASHREF

InlineStates holds a hashref of callbacks to handle custom events.
The hashref follows the same form as POE::Session->create()'s
inline_states parameter.

=item ObjectStates => ARRAYREF

ObjectStates holds a list reference of objects and the events they
handle.  The ARRAYREF follows the same form as POE::Session->create()'s
object_states parameter.

=item PackageStates => ARRAYREF

PackageStates holds a list reference of Perl package names and the
events they handle.  The ARRAYREF follows the same form as
POE::Session->create()'s package_states parameter.

=item Port => SCALAR

Port contains the port the listening socket will be bound to.  It
defaults to INADDR_ANY, which usually lets the operating system pick a
port at random.

  Port => 30023

=item SessionParams => ARRAYREF

SessionParams specifies additional parameters that will be passed to
the SessionType constructor at creation time.  It must be an array
reference.

  SessionParams => [ options => { debug => 1, trace => 1 } ],

It is important to realize that some of the arguments to
SessionHandler may get clobbered when defining them for your
SessionHandler.  It is advised that you stick to defining arguments in
the "options" hash such as trace and debug. See L<POE::Session> for an
example list of options.

=item SessionType => SCALAR

SessionType specifies what type of sessions will be created within the
TCP server.  It must be a scalar value.

  SessionType => "POE::Session::MultiDispatch"

SessionType is optional.  The component will create POE::Session
instances if a new type isn't specified.

=item Started => CODEREF

Started sets a callback that will be invoked within the main server
session's context.  It notifies your code that the server has started.
Its parameters are the usual for a session's _start handler.

Started is optional.

=item Concurrency => SCALAR

Controls the number of connections that may be open at the same time.
Defaults to -1, which means unlimited number of simutaneous connections.
0 means no connections.  This value may be set via the
C<set_concurrency> event, see L<EVENTS>.

Note that if you define the C<Acceptor> callback, you will have to inform
the TCP server session that a connection was closed. This is done by sending
a C<disconnected> event to your session's parent. This is only necessary if
you define an C<Acceptor> callback.  For C<ClientInput>, it's all handled
for you.

Example:

  Acceptor => sub {
    # ....
    POE::Session->create(
      # ....
      inline_states => {
        _start => sub {
          # ....
          # remember who our parent is
          $_[HEAP]->{server_tcp} = $_[SENDER]->ID;
          # ....
        },
        got_client_disconnect => sub {
          # ....
          $_[KERNEL]->post( $_[HEAP]->{server_tcp} => 'disconnected' );
          # ....
        }
      }
    );
  }

=head1 EVENTS

It's possible to manipulate a TCP server component by sending it
messages.

=over 2

=item shutdown

Shuts down the TCP server.  This entails destroying the SocketFactory
that's listening for connections and removing the TCP server's alias,
if one is set.

Active connections are not shut down until they disconnect.

=item disconnected

Inform the TCP server that a connection was closed.  This is only necessary
when using C<Concurrency> is set and you are using an L<Acceptor> callback.

=item set_concurrency

Set the number of simultaneous connections.  See L<Concurrency> above.

  $kernel->call( "tcp_server_alias", "set_concurrency", $max_count );

=back

=head1 BUGS

This looks nothing like what Ann envisioned.

This component currently does not accept many of the options that
POE::Wheel::SocketFactory does.

This component will not bind to several addresses at once.  This may
be a limitation in SocketFactory.

This component needs more complex error handling which appends for
construction errors and replaces for runtime errors, instead of
replacing for all.
