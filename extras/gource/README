This directory contains the scripts+files needed to make a visualization
of the POE git history using Gource.

Apocalypse uploaded the vid he made here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex05VzDc0JY

To do this, you need to download gource and install it on your machine. Also, you will
need ffmpeg and the mp4 codec installed. Naturally, you need a X display for it to work.

After that's done, you can run the make_gource.sh file and it will dump the video
as "gource_POE.mp4"

The gravatars for POE committers up to March 15, 2010 is already in avatars/ but
if you need to re-generate them, run "get_gravatars.pl" to figure it out :)

Have fun playing with Gource!
