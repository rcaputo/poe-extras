This directory contains the scripts+files needed to make a visualization
of the POE git history using Gource.

To do this, you need to download Gource and install it on your machine. Also, you will
need ffmpeg and the mp4 codec installed. Naturally, you need a X display for it to work.

You would need to edit the "get_gravatars.pl" file for your path then run it to
download all the known gravatars for POE committers.

After that's done, you can run the make_gource.sh file and it will dump the video
as "gource_POE.mp4"

Have fun playing with Gource!
